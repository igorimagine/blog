<h1>Kustomize + ArgoCD: A great first impression</h1>
<h2>2023-12-18</h2>
<p>My team recently switched from using Harness to using Kustomize + ArgoCD due to better pricing, based on our size and needs.</p>
<p>Kustomize offers a way to customize application configuration, via yaml files, including, for example, feature flags per environment. ArgoCD adds a great visualized GitOps layer over Kustomize.</p>
<p>While a more thorough write-up will have to wait, I have to admit this combination left a strong first impression, and I feel proud to have a chance to use it professionally.</p>
