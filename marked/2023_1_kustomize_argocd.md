# Kustomize + ArgoCD: A great first impression

## 2023-12-18

My team recently switched from using Harness to using Kustomize + ArgoCD due to better pricing, based on our size and needs.

Kustomize offers a way to customize application configuration, via yaml files, including, for example, feature flags per environment. ArgoCD adds a great visualized GitOps layer over Kustomize.

While a more thorough write-up will have to wait, I have to admit this combination left a strong first impression, and I feel proud to have a chance to use it professionally.
